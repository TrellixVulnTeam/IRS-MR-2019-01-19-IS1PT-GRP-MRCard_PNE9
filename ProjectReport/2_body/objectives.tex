\subsection{Objectives} % (fold)
\label{sub:objectives}
	The objective of this project is to create a credit card recommendation system (MRCard) that will recommend the most suitable credit card (from major banks in Singapore) to a consumer based on their spending habits and preferences. MRCard will make use of \textbf{rule-based reasoning} and \textbf{fuzzy logic}, to match the consumer’s input against a database of credit card features. As MRCard features most of the major banks in Singapore, it should be applicable to almost anyone living in Singapore.

	The primary target audience of MRCard are consumers, people from the general public. However, MRCard can also very much be utilised by banks as a tool for market awareness, evaluation, as well as training (An example is given in Scenario 2 in Appendix A).

	By inputting in their preferences and spending habits, MRCard will be able to analyse and reason based on the inputs, and finally recommend a credit card that is most beneficial to them. Banks can also make use of MRCard to understand the competition, as well as use it to provide training and reference especially for frontline staff.

		Knowledge modeling can be classified into three parts \cite{schreiber2001knowledge}
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item Knowledge identification
			\item Knowledge specification
			\item Knowledge refinement

		Different tasks and components are done at each stage to derive the final recommendation of ideal credit card.

	\subsubsection{Knowledge Identification} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:knowledge_identification}
		Knowledge identification sets the groundwork for the next stage encompassing knowledge specification. Information sources that are deemed to be useful are identified in preparation of knowledge acquisition. In the context of building a recommender system for credit card recommendation, three main sources have been identified and are documented in Table \ref{table:knowledgesource}.

	\subsubsection{Knowledge Acquisition} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:knowledge_acquisition}
		Following from the identification of knowledge sources, knowledge acquisition is conducted to capture the problem-solving domain knowledge. The techniques adopted to acquire the knowledge have been describe in Table \ref{table:knowledgesource} and the corresponding results are presented using a dependency diagram as shown in Figure \ref{fig:knowledge_model}.

			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/knowledge_model.png}
			\caption{Dependency Diagram of Credit Card Recommendation System}
			\label{fig:knowledge_model}
		\end{figure}

		The dependency diagram arranges the factors affecting user's choice of credit cards in a hierarchical tree structure. The top most level node represents the description of the proposed system, which in this case, recommends a group of credit cards to the user. This decision can be broken down into multiple layers of inferable sub-goals or sub-factors before arriving at a list of “observables”. These “observables” are gathered from users of the proposed system and they represent their inherent preference. Table \ref{table:exampe_depedency} illustrates an example using the dependency diagram in Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture_diagram}.

		The inferable sub-goals together with the “observables” are in fact, derived from the advices and insights provided by the domain expert and following validated by survey results. Full interview transcript and audio, together with the survey results and analysis, are appended in \textit{Appendix C} for submission.

	\subsubsection{Knowledge Specification} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:knowledge_specification}
		After data is acquired from Banks Credit Card website, the next stage is to transform the unstructured data into decision-making domain knowledge, and this would require to form a calculation logic for different types of credit card.

		Data from the Credit Card Website only mentions the maximum cashback/reward that a client can get, while the terms and conditions specify the criteria and cap for each spending category. Our team did an analysis and established the formula to calculate cash back or reward points:

		\lstset{basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily}
		% \lstset{frame=bottomline}
		\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, gobble=11, tabsize=4, showstringspaces=false, mathescape]
			Cashback of Credit Card =

			IF Minimum Spending is met, THEN
			(For each category)
			$\sum$(min(Credit Card Spending * Cashback Higher Rate, Cashback Cap))
			ElSE
			$\sum$(min(Credit Card Spending * Cashback Lower Rate, Cashback Cap))
			END

			Reward Points of Credit Card = $\sum$((min(Round_Down_To_Nearest_Integer
			(Credit Card Spending/Reward Points Lot) * Reward Points Multiplier),
			Reward Points Cap)

			Miles of Credit Card = Reward Points of Credit Card *
			Reward Points to Miles conversion rate
		\end{lstlisting}

		Based on the user’s spending or estimated spending amount on each category, the logic can calculate the maximum cashback/reward points for each credit card. These values are used to compare and recommend the most suitable credit card for the user.

		MRCard recommends both an ideal credit card and a preferred credit Card. The user’s preference is only taken into account in determining which type of preferred credit card the system recommends. If the user only chooses a cashback card, MRCard will only take cashback cards into consideration. If the user is open to both cashback and reward cards, the system will convert the reward points to an equivalent cash value and suggest the most valuable (maximum cash equivalent) card to user. MRCard also provides an ideal credit card based solely on the user’s eligibility, disregarding his/her preferences.

		The conversion between reward points to equivalent cash value is done via Fuzzy logic.

		\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, gobble=11, tabsize=4, showstringspaces=false, mathescape]
			Cash Value = Reward Points / Fuzzy Factor
		\end{lstlisting}

	\subsubsection{Knowledge Refinement} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:knowledge_refinement}
		The Knowledge Refinement is an iterative process and it includes model validation and model refinement. For model validation, different sets of test data will be used to run the simulation, and the result will be compared with current spending habit data.

		For model refinement, certainty factors is included to incorporate the uncertainty of user preference and change of terms and conditions of the card. The model needs to be revised periodically with live data.
